Our project provides a new measure to be used by researchers interested in a complete and exhaustive data set of economic sanctions by the U.S. We use web-scraping and text-analysis techniques to collect a set of government documents where the U.S. Congress or President issued a sanction-related text on foreign nations or entities.  We employ supervised machine-learning to identify all documents connected to sanctions-activities by the U.S. and their associated violations. 
We document the precise nature of the data-gathering process and code for each sanctions case a set of variables that provide comprehensive details, for example, about the senders, targets, issues, measures, conditionality, and trajectory. 

**Recently, our paper decscribing the data and making it available, has been conditionally accepted at the Journal of Peace Research. You can read it on SSRN here https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3790866.**
