abstract = "The United States uses economic sanctions more than any other power, and American policy makers cite human rights issues as the most frequent justification of sanctions.   International human rights standards, embodied in a range of treaties and institutions,  commit countries to observe a wide gamut of rights and freedoms.  We investigate whether, when and how U.S. sanctions help this emerging human rights regime.  We argue that there are two types of enforcement of international human rights standards that are possible: dedicated enforcement, in which any violator of a specific standard would be punished, and diffuse enforcement, in which specific violators of any standard are punished.  We develop a theoretical argument that distinguishes the incentives and capacity of Congress and the Presidency to agree to sanction human rights violations.  We argue that agreement between the branches with an international human right standard is important and difficult, which explains why dedicated enforcement is difficult.  At the same time, even without such agreement, diffuse enforcement is possible, in which Congress, and not the President, sanction violators of human rights standards.  We argue that international treaties make more of a difference for the price non-compliers pay than what has been understood to date."
