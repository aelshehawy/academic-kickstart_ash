abstract = "We use this the crisis set off by the arrival of asylum-seekers in Germany to test a theory of the use of propaganda as a strategy by a non-democratic state against a democratic state.  We argue that a non-democracy on a collision course with a democracy will use propaganda discourse to punish recalcitrant elite, and will do so especially near elections, while promoting frames that weaken the opponent’s institutions.  We test these propositions on a corpus of half a million publications, covering Kremlin-backed media channels broadcasting in German, and German media.  We find that Kremlin-backed channels are more likely to publish refugee stories near elections in Germany, and that they push conspiracy theories at the expense of discussing economic or crime-related aspects of immigration.  Our work has implications for the rise of propaganda discourse in Europe and beyond, and for democratic politics under foreign autocratic pressure."
