Take a look at my personal [blog](https://5e569ddfda1c820008d2ea0f--ashrakatelshehawy.netlify.com/landing/). The main emphasis of my blog is to make academia more accessabile for Arab Researchers. I will post here about opportunities that I learn about as I navigate the academic world. Other than that, I will be posting about fascinating things I learn through my travel and in my home country. Expect some movie and book reviews.
