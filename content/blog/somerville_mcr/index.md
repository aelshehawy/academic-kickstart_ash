Starting 9th Week of Hillary Term I have been voted in as the New **Middle Common Room (MCR) President** of Somerville College, University of Oxford.
I will be documenting about academic and intellectual life of Somerville College. It is fascinating place that has a strong history in supporting women in Academia and I am proud to be able to represent the Graduate communities' interests in College.
