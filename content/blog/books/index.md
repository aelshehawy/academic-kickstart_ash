My absolute favorite read about Egypt is by the Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz. The Cairo triology has been translated in several languages, including English.

This graphic novel is a gem. It is written by [Malaka Gharib](https://twitter.com/MalakaGharib). The novel revolves around her life in Egypt with her dad and step-mom and how one can form unique boundaries despote the language barriers. The book is so interesting as it provides an overview of the variations in the perception of American culture by Egyptian teanagers and adults.
