I have studied in Mannheim for my undergraduate and graduate studies. 
I chose to study in Mannheim early on because its quantitative focus and the variety of research centres that 
are associated with the University. 
This gave me a very early start as an undergraduate to participate in high quality research in institutes such as GESIS and MZES. My academic experience is Mannheim has also been shaped by its internationality and by its cooperations with other world renowned Universities, for example, I had the opportunity to visit at Trinity College Dublin as an undergraduate.
My specific research focus lies on economic aspects of institution-making, inequality, and 
resource distribution in authoritarian regimes, I am also focusing on methods of computational text-analysis of Arabic Text.
As my research borrows from economics, data science, and political science, the cross-disciplinary research environment in 
Mannheim has supported my passion for producing research that crosses boundaries between different research fields. 
To support my academic career, Mannheim has offered me opportunities to teach, become a part of the APSR editorial team, be a part of research group of the Chair of Empirical Democracy Research led by Prof. Nikolay Marinov, and also the Mannheim Center for European Social research. The integration of the Master with the PhD programme through the fast-track PhD provided me with an excellent opportunity during my second MA year to take more methodologically sophisticated classes to complement my methodological knowledge.
At the University of Mannheim I have met excellent professors, 
mentors, and co-authors that I have learned almost everything I know from them and that I am eternally grateful for. 
Taking full advantage of the open opportunities at Mannheim, eventually made it possible for me to start pursuing my 
doctoral studies at the University of Oxford.
