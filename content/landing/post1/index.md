Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Egypt, I have always wondered how one can become an academic and get a top-class education with low financial resources. Academia seemed for me unaccessible, especially for an Arab woman. \n
I was fortunate to attend the [German School of Alexandria (Deutsche Schule der Borrom√§erinnen Alexandria - DSBA)](http://dsb-alexandria.de/), one of my teachers mentioned once in class that as Arab women we have to think critically. I remember that I struggled with that thought a lot I did not know what he meant or how I should think critically. But the more I thought of it, the more I knew that I have a deep desire for knowledge and learning. I was sure that I will do anything to get the education I always wanted to get. The road to being a doctoral student was tough. I was sometimes frustrated by the fact that because of my citizenship I could not apply to many scholarships. But I learned so much a long the way about opportunities in different countries that are available for international students, specifically Arabs, to earn the education they dream of. I am very thankful for everyone who helped me along the way and this blog is a way to give back some of the knowledge that I gained. I will be posting here every now and then about sources that can inform students about ways to study abroad and about accessability to research.
