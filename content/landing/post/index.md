While at Oxford I met Kaelyn Grace Apple, who is studying towards her Mst degree in history at Oxford.
She is historian and an incoming student in Fall 2020 to the PhD Programme of History at Yale. Previously she studied as an undergrad at UCLA.
Her [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrD1Qi9M48e5o9fSC3vRdXw?view_as=subscriber) channel includes great content about access to higher education for aspiring students.
She also runs an admission [counseling service](https://theredheadacademic.com/counseling/).
