I am a visiting scholar at the Department of Political Science of the University of Houston. In October 2019 I will be joining the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford as a Doctoral Student. 

My research interests include comparitive political economy of authoritarian regimes. I focus on aspects related to colonialism and state-building, the political economy of Islamic institutions, informal social-welfare by non-state actors, and business-politics relationships in the Middle East. I am also interested in investigating propaganda methods and conspiracy theories using methods of computional text analysis. I have a lot of fun exploring how Arabic text can be a valuable resource in understanding important developments and relationships in the Arab world.  

I have been born and raised in the beautiful city Alexandria, Egypt. I am a former professional swimmer for the Egyptian Swimming National Team, for which I competed professionally for several years. I come up with what I believe to be my best ideas while doing those endless labs in the pool. I love reading about Islamic Art and Architecture.
