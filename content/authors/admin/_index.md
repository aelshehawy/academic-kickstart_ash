I am a doctoral candidate at the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford. I was recently a visiting PhD student at Yale. Before Oxford, I studied at Mannheim focusing on Advanced Quantitative Methods in Political Science. I was a pre-doc/visiting scholar at th University of Houston before starting my PhD.

My research focuses on the _Political Economy of Development_ and _Foreign Influence on Domestic Political Economy_. I work on aspects related to the foreign influence on local economic development, economic history of local public good provision, and the political economy of Islamic institutions, with a regional focus on the Middle.  In a further research agenda, I focus on the political economy of information. My published work underlines my strong interest in evaluating the impact of past and present foreign interventions on how societies operate, in applications beyond the region of the Middle East. 

Methodologically, I work on generating new sources of quantitative data that reveal valuable infromation that would be otherwise lost in the archives. 
My work incorporates retrieval and digitalization of historical maps, textual data, and several other sources of archival data; other than that my work employs and expands methods of Computational Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing using corpora of Arabic, German, English, and French texts.

My research has been published or is forthcoming at the _Journal of Politics_, _Perspectives on Politics_, and _Journal of Peace Research_.

I am a former professional swimmer for the Egyptian Swimming National Team, for which I competed professionally for several years. I still find myself thinking more clearly while doing all those endless laps at the pool. I enjoy reading about Islamic Art and Architecture.
