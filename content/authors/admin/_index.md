<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's King Center on Global Development. I hold a PhD in Politics from the University of Oxford. I visited Yale during my PhD and before Oxford, I studied at Mannheim focusing on Advanced Quantitative Methods in Political Science. <br><br>

My research focuses on topics related to the Political Economy of Development and Economic History, with a focus on identity and inequality.
 <br><br>

My methodological expertise lies in the field of Computational Social Sciences. I employ and advance methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Text Analysis in a multilingual setting, working with a variety of Western and Arabic languages.  <br><br>

My work incorporates retrieval and digitalization of historical maps, textual data, and several other sources of archival data. 
I am passionate about using my computational skills to generate new sources of quantitative data that reveal valuable information that would be otherwise lost in the archives. <br><br>

My research has been published or is forthcoming at the <em>Journal of Politics, Perspectives on Politics, and Journal of Peace Research</em>.
 <br><br>

I am a former professional swimmer for the Egyptian Swimming National Team, for which I competed professionally for several years. I still find myself thinking more clearly while doing all those endless laps at the pool. I enjoy reading about Islamic Art and Architecture. </p>
