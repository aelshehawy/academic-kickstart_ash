# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio:  My research interests incorporates prospects of comparative political economy of the Middle East.  I focus on aspects related to economic history of state-institutions, local public good provision, informal social-welfare, and the political economy of Islamic institutions, with a regional focus of the Middle East. My research also draws on questions about how foreign policy tools, such as economic sanctions, interact with domestic politics. I am extremely interested in investigating aspects of the politics of information using methods of NLP and computational text analysis.

Currently, I am a visiting PhD student at Yale! I am a doctoral student at the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford. Before Oxford, I studied at Mannheim and was a pre-doc/visiting scholar at the University of Houston.

My research interests lie in the field of comparative political economy. I focus on aspects related to economic history of state-institutions, local public good provision, informal social-welfare, and the political economy of Islamic institutions, with a regional focus of the Middle East. My research also draws on questions related to the politics of information, and how foreign policy tools, such as economic sanctions, interact with domestic politics. 

I am very interested in generating new sources of data that reveal valuable infromation that would be otherwise lost in the archives. I work on digitizing historical maps, textual data, and several sources of archival data; other than that I am extremely interested in employing methods of Computational Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing on corpora of Arabic, German, English, and French texts.

I have been born and raised in the beautiful city Alexandria, Egypt. I am a former professional swimmer for the Egyptian Swimming National Team, for which I competed professionally for several years. I still find myself thinking more clearly while doing all those endless laps at the pool. I enjoy reading about Islamic Art and Architecture.
