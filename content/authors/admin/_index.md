I am a Doctoral Student at the University of Oxford.  I hold a Masters Degree in Political Science from the University of Mannheim, where I focused on Advanced Quantitative Methods. I hold a Bachelors degree in Political Science and Psychology also from the University of Mannheim. I was a visiting undergraduate student at Trinity College Dublin. In Mannheim I was involved in research projects at Gesis and Mannheim Center for European Social Research, I taught Research Design, and was part of the editorial team of the American Political Science Review. Before joining Oxford I was a visiting scholar at the University of Houston.

I have been born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt. I've had the amazing opportunity to be a part of the Egyptian Swimming National Team for seven years, travelling around for my swimming competitions, especially in Arabic countries
